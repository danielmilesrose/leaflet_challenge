USGS Earthquake Map

Module 15 -- Leaflet Challenge\
In this project we use earthquake data from the USGS and visualize this data on a map to show the location, depth, and magnitude of the earthquake.  Specifically, I have chosen to visualize the data for all Earthquakes that were above a Magnitude of 1.0 from the past seven days.\

I used Javascript with Leaflet to create this map from the GeoJSON data provided from the USGS site.  D3, HTML, and CSS were also used to create this visualization.
